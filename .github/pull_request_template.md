## Summary

Describe the scoped change and why it is needed.

## Throughput checklist

- [ ] PR is narrow and short-lived.
- [ ] `./scripts/ci/repo_sanity.sh` passes locally.
- [ ] Blocking gate is green: `repo-sanity`.
- [ ] Advisory check results were reviewed.

## Advisory failure handling

- [ ] If an advisory check failed, I re-ran it at least once.
- [ ] If it still failed and looked flaky, I linked a follow-up issue.

Follow-up issue (if any): #
